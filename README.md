# Image classification using PyTorch
The project is an image classification task, where the goal is to predict the input image. The input image is preprocessed and then passed through a pretrained deep learning model to obtain the predictions.

The project involves uploading a picture of an object and using a computer program to automatically identify what the object is. The program uses a pre-trained deep learning model, which has been trained on a large dataset of images, to make predictions about the class of the input image.

The project uses several technical tools to achieve its goal:
PyTorch, ResNet101, Torchvision, PIL (Python Imaging Library)

In terms of skillset, the project demonstrates several key skills, including:

- Understanding of deep learning concepts: This project requires a basic understanding of deep learning concepts, such as neural networks and image classification.

- Knowledge of deep learning libraries: The project requires knowledge of how to use PyTorch and Torchvision to perform image classification using a deep learning model.

- Image preprocessing: The project requires knowledge of how to preprocess an image so that it can be used as input to a deep learning model.

- Model evaluation: The project requires knowledge of how to evaluate a deep learning model and interpret its predictions.

The project provides a good introduction to some of the key concepts and skills involved in this area, and can serve as a starting point for further exploration and experimentation.
